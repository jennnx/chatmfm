 And what he was doing was every day he would wake up at like whatever five or six in the morning and he would go to Phil's coffee and he would sit down on his laptop. He firstly tweet out that he was at Phil's every single day and then he would start just literally emailing and tweeting at people that they should be posting their product on product hunt or hey I posted it for you would love to hear your comment or hey I noticed this product that's a lot like yours I wonder if you know or like that's in your industry you should check this out and all he was doing was like manually being the human notification system for product time he was the he was the human invite system the notification system the retention system he was all of it I have a feeling you're coming with fire or something you seem fiery today I got some good stuff also I just watched do you ever watch Barstool's interviews with people you watch are you talking about the Caleb Presley one I don't know who that is maybe that's his name it's the one with Aaron Rogers I watched it today dude his name's Caleb have you seen it so it's called uh it's called Sunday conversations and basically like ice cream yeah it's like this like chubby guy named Glennie Balls who's sitting in the background and then it's Caleb who's like a bro but he's kind of he's actually really funny he's hilarious he's quite smart and he interviews these people he asks the best questions he's so good have you seen the past ones I've seen a few of them this one is the first one I've watched like the whole thing and uh god he's good man he that is amazing so I watched that and sometimes that's all it takes you just see someone being great at their thing and you're like I'm gonna be great today that's it I'm gonna be great today I saw great now I need now I need to be great he makes me self-conscious Caleb Presley is is is very very good at these funny awesome interviews he's great on the spot he's very good yeah he delivers um all right so let's do can I tell you something this is kind of amazing all right this is going to be a little hard to share on here but I put this in to the doc so you can click the links uh Ben if you can let's screen share some of this stuff that's going to I'm going to tell you this is I saw this ad on Instagram and this is the most amazing marketing funnel I've ever seen maybe ever but definitely for a musician so check this out stop scrolling you have 24 hours where carol an independent hip-hop group last year we had the honor of being placed on Brock Hampton's official community playlist and we were also shouted out by Kenny B's kira lanka go off I bet you can do it this year we're trying to grow our fan base so for the first 15 people who dm us on instagram in the next 24 hours we're going to send you a special gift swipe up to dms now so the beginning of the the audio didn't play that but he goes do you recognize these people and it's like biggie pock whoever like just like a bunch of famous rappers it goes stop scrolling and then he basically does this little thing so I was like so so uh Ben Levy Ben sent this to me and I was like what is this amazingness let me I I must swipe up I must know what this free gift is so I do it what does that lead you to it opens up facebook messenger with a direct message already ready for their like for their team and it just says send it automatically sends them a message from you saying send me the free gift okay so that happens and then they they respond yo what's good immediately right so you're like okay I don't know what's happening here but I'm intrigued the next thing that happens I have screenshots of this stuff um below your below some of your research so they go yo Sean what's good so they use my name in the in the thing they pull it from facebook messenger and then it says give us a little bit we'll get back to you ASAP with your gift and some more details thanks for your patience okay cool one day later I get a message it's an audio note from the guys who are the the rap group and it's basically like introducing themselves and and again this is kind of mass produced but it works they go yo Sean and then it's the audio which is like yo here's our story we're these guys blah blah here's what we're doing and then they said um you know for your gift we wrote you your own custom song we personalized the lyrics just for you and um and so you know let me know what you think it's links to us it's links to their soundcloud and it says Sean king of the first million that's the name of the song so then so they send the song and I'm like okay well I don't know what's happening right now but like this has never happened before where you go from there's an instagram and instagram ad about a band that you never heard of that you swipe up then they send you an audio note and a personal message then they send you a song the following day that's like got your name in it and then they follow it up again and they're like yo um I don't know if you're in New York I'm gonna pretend you are we're doing a show here's the here's a link to a show here's the tickets and then they send like this automated graphic using canva of you can see it there it's like me crowd surfing uh it's like well down I don't know what is going on but this band is kind of genius in the way that they're promoting themselves and they're still small they're called caralanka they're still small but when I saw this I was like I don't know they may not they may or may not be the best musician but they are probably have the highest overlap of market like kind of marketing genius for a young band and they play music right it's like there's a lot of marketing genius out there but they don't make music there's a lot of musicians but they don't know anything about marketing these guys know enough about both to be very dangerous I just thought this is amazing is this uh effective you think I don't understand so they're basically doing all this to get you to buy tickets to their New York show is that right well it's not just that like it's not just to buy tickets to that specific show it's basically the way I think about it is every business you got to find a way to get like your first hundred or first thousand customers who love you and that's like a really specific thing it's like I just need a thousand customers who love us whether it was for this podcast like we needed a thousand people to listen who actually really love the show and um and every business has this and so the question is like how do you actually do that and uh at YC they have this thing that they say do things that don't scale they talked about the early Airbnb guys how they used to go and they themselves would go and call all the hosts of their New York Airbnb's they would go to their houses they would take professional looking photos so that the listings look better and people were always laughing like you know that's not going to scale and they're like well first of all it doesn't even matter if it scales because right now I don't need scale I don't have scale I just need something that's going to get a thousand people to really love us and um that's what these guys are doing I thought this is just an amazing example of like actually betting on that strategy which is that you need a small group of people to really love you and go to bat for you not a bunch of people who just kind of sort of like you or oh yeah I got you know we got 10,000 views on this thing it's like okay but those those views do they matter what are those views worth versus somebody who's got a story to tell like I'm doing right now or somebody who's really impressed by you or feels interested in you or is invested in your story actually goes and clicks and learns more about you and you know it goes deeper down your funnel so I think that this is amazing because they're showing they're brute forcing that thousand thousand fans who really care about them dude I always hated this thing of well it doesn't scale or you got to build the scale I've always hated that conversation for a few reasons number one most people aren't going to make it to the point where they ever have to worry about that number two you can brute force it and just manually and by hand do things to a pretty large number I think the largest number that I've seen let's see I think Mr. Beast is his whole operation is worth hundreds of millions of dollars that's a pretty brute force not I don't know what it looks like but just talking to him fairly unsophisticated operation I think when I talked to nerd wall you know nerd wall it's a it was a blog that was at the time making like 30 million in revenue and I think like 15 million in profit incredibly I like saw a little bit behind the scenes super unsophisticated what are some other things and it was basically just them just blogging what are some other examples of things that you've seen that are look like a tech or internet based company on the outside but behind the scenes are like pretty rudimentary and not even like they've not even thought like oh we need to automate or scale or whatever so our buddy Ryan Hoover built product time and he listens to pot so he came on the pot as well and told the story but I was there kind of front row when he was building that thing meaning like I think I'm user number 17 in product that's history or something like that like very very early first dozen people or so that were on the platform and so and for some of us he was sending like updates on like literally what he was doing to build it and what he was doing was every day he would wake up at like whatever five or six in the morning and he would go to Phil's coffee and he would sit down on his laptop first he'd tweet out that he was at Phil's every single day and then he would start just literally emailing and tweeting at people that they should be posting their product on product hunt or hey I posted it for you would love to hear your comment or hey I noticed this product that's a lot like yours I wonder if you know or like that's in your industry you should check this out and all he was doing was like manually being the human notification system for product time he was the he was the human invite system the notification system the retention system he was all of it and at the time I was like this guy's literally like sending out like hundreds of personal welcome emails and maybe a hundred personalized tweets per day and then he would like you know sure enough by six or seven pm he'd close up his laptop he'd go to the gym he's a very like structured guy and then he would like go home he he hits the bed early he's not like you know he's not like going out and socializing or doing anything like that he'd wake up again the next day and he would do the same thing and sure enough that community that we were part of I think that first group he sent it to was like maybe 25 people and it didn't even have his own website he was using this thing called linky dink at the time it's like some third-party tool to go use and every day he would send out the email more email digest in the morning of the cool stuff people posted and then he would tag each person with an individualized thing oh Sean I know you guys had once looked at building a product like this what do you think about this he'd get you to share your thoughts because he was asking in such a nice personalized way that okay I'll go ahead and reply but that generated all of the activity for that early community and why did product not work why did it sell for 20 million dollars well because at the beginning he got the right people from Silicon Valley to actually participate in the thing and the way he did that was like it's like when you watch somebody build a fire it's like first they're just like you know they're just hitting the the flint or they're rubbing the two sticks together just to get the spark and then when it's there they're sort of covering it they're just blowing on it gently and then they're adding just the next little few pieces of sticks and they know it could go out at any moment and that's how it feels to build a community I saw you do the same thing with trends basically right like for trends when you wanted to launch that it was by no means going to be a slam dunk and I think most of us who are in trends would say the research reports you guys sent out which was the product they were cool but the real reason anybody liked trends I think was the Facebook group and all it was was a Facebook group it was nothing you didn't build that you just literally went down there and typed a fight typed a you know a title in and hit enter and then but what made the Facebook group good was you picked you hand picked who could get in and then every day I felt like you were sharing like some super high quality stuff to get a conversation started in the group chat was that intentional when you do that 100% that was intentional and so when I did two or three interesting things so this yeah so trends right now is making many many millions of dollars in subscription revenue and it's pretty simple and there's like I think there's only five people who work on it so it's like a pretty profitable thing and we added these people to this Facebook group and I would do a few things the first thing I would do is even people who didn't pay who I thought were impressive like you or some of our other friends I'd be like hey I'm adding you to this group and I would just tell them and I would manually add them and I'd be like oh look who just joined you know it's Sean Sean has done all these impressive things funny seeing you here how cool if you have any questions for Sean just like ask him right here in the comments and I would do that all the time so I would add these people who did that that worked by the way because I was like oh shit this group has cool people and it's in reality that you added 300 paid members that I've never heard of and then you added one interesting person but you made that intro post baller you're like you ever seen a plane fly yeah that's because of this guy you know it's like it was always the most like ball or intro you're like um you know did you know they didn't have hundred dollar bills till this guy came around it's like wow I did that all the time and the other thing I would do is I would just write out all these long posts of like interesting things that I was thinking about and then I would tag certain people who a either accomplish something like that and would talk about it or b I would write comments for smart people and message them and say hey will you do me a favor post this on there or I would write posts for other people and make them comment one time uh when HubSpot was looking to buy us I saw that Brian Halligan the then he's the founder and then of the company he joined and I messaged like 80 people and I said hey uh reply to reply to Brian here's a message to say to him and so many people commented and then he checked in like eight hours later he's like oh my god I've been overwhelmed with replies and notifications I can't believe how thriving this community is uh and I remember thinking like got him got him and that's but that like interaction is how you make all like that's that feeling you want all community members to feel and we used to do that all the time but yeah Ryan Hoover is a good example of people who have grown without like really caring about scaring scaling we should have like a segment another time where we like actually think about like the most like thrown together duct tape shit that we've seen that has gotten quite large um and I'm gonna give you another um angle towards this so there's one which is the brute force do things that don't scale and they almost do them even longer than that they do it even past the point where you shouldn't be able to keep this up like Airbnb still does that photographer thing by the way they turned that unscalable thing of them going to people's apartments taking photos for them and saying hey we'll improve your listing for you and now they just have a fleet of photographers around the country that'll just come do this for your listing it's like it's that they actually turned it into a scalable thing and that's another thing when people talk about well that's not scalable it's like uh yeah it is like they'll talk about like an ad agency and they're like that's not scalable it's like what do you mean of course it's scalable you just hire 5,000 employees like that that's scalable and maybe that's not what you want to do but like yeah everything virtually everything is scalable like you just have to add a ton of people probably most things can scale past what most people think uh like you know this also happens in engineering all the time you work with engineers and they're like well we're gonna need to build it right before we launch or we're gonna need to build it right because this won't work in production and so this won't work when it scales it's like then you hear these stories it's like yeah Facebook was written in PHP why I don't know that's just the language he knew at the time that's what he did you know it's like and yeah actually it still runs you know years later it was still running in that like way past where it was supposed to um and dude I I've got friends that are early at Uber and friends that are still at Uber and a lot of people don't know this but I they might consider him a founder but the first or second employee was this Mexican guy and you know he like I think he was lived in America for a little while but at the time he was living in Mexico and so the early versions of Uber were written with a ton of Spanish in the code and and so my friends who were early there they told me yeah like I forget this guy's name do you know who I'm talking about I remember reading about about I don't know his name topic yeah he was he was Mexican and so they and he had you know his friends in Mexico were like yeah well well I might I know a good agency we're gonna have him do it and they said it was kind of thrown together and kind of janky and I've got friends now that still work there and they say every once in a while we'll find Spanish in the early code base because that is you know what these guys are writing we'll find like Spanish notes and things like that and that was the early version of Uber and think about how many rules of Uber got violated of how many rules of startups that Uber violated so for example the Uber founders Travis and Garrett they didn't work on it full time Uber was not a project they were willing to do they just literally tweeted out hey we need a general manager and random guy named Ryan Graves was like I'm a hustler I'll do it and they're like all right cool it's like they literally like delegated the CEO job then did they have a super strong technical team technical co-founder who could write the code and do this in house nope use the third-party dev shop to build the first version of the app they outsourced the coding yeah most of the investors who invested in Uber would tell you if you're a product guy and you go in and you say yeah I'm gonna just use an agency to write the code for the app they'd be like uh yeah this is not yeah no go okay then what's the next thing then they literally broke actual laws it was like running and they got a cease and desist from San Francisco saying hey for every day your operational you owe us five thousand dollars per day and they just kept going then the next you know they just violated rule another one at the time I remember at the time when Uber first came out Airbnb was was popular at the time and I talked to our investor I was like should we be doing a product like this he's like ah no bits not atoms that was like a common phrase in Silicon Valley which is you want to do startups that are software based because they can they're the ones that can scale and have profit margins all these things with real world cars and homes and t-shirts and stuff like that like that stuff super hard to scale ends up being super super low margin and okay you know some people say oh they're right you know Uber's not that profitable but the reality is that the founders and investors in Uber did fantastically well scaling this thing up and it was kind of a narrative violation there was all these narrative violations all these these general rules that were broken that like today if you said yeah I'm the I'm the founder of this thing no I'm not working on it full time I found a guy on Twitter to be the CEO and then we're using this agency in Mexico to build the app yeah we're the next big thing that doesn't fly and guess what it worked dude we got to go on a quick story tangent that's kind of what this whole first half is going to be I guess but there's this guy named Scott Belsky I'm friends with them or I used to be a little uh friends with them I haven't talked to him in a while but you do you know Scott yeah I'm I like him a lot I like to think of friends with them the reality is I've talked to him twice yeah friendly with him he invested in my company and I've hung out with him once or twice he doesn't know this but he's kind of like I'm his secret admirer like he's like this like good looking handsome dude who dresses nice nice and seems like really wealthy and rich and like I like and I see him I'm like dude you're the best and I've talked to him if you have 10 million dollars and a jawline Jess is all in Sam is all in yeah yeah definitely all in so like I love this guy and uh he's great so basically I gotta tell you a quick Scott Belsky story so right now he's like uh an executive at Adobe but not just like an executive I'm pretty sure he's like in line to be CEO and a lot of people don't realize this Adobe is one of like the 30th largest companies in the world I think their market cap is like three four hundred billion dollars and Scott Belsky is he's pretty young he's in his early 40s and he uh I cold emailed him to invest in the hustle and that's how I became friends with him and I met with him one time and he goes yeah so like when I was 26 years old I was starting my company called Behance so Behance is basically it's Behance and Dribble are like the two companies where you go online and designers can host their portfolio and kind of talk to one another and he was like I was just starting this company and in my head I knew he worked at Goldman and I knew that he was from like a wealthy like Jewish family I think his his grandfather started like Kaplan you know Kaplan University yeah and so I was like stereotyping him as oh you guys just you had everything handed to to him and like you told me a few stories where I was like oh you actually like it's not exactly how it seems from the outside and he said I left Goldman and I was making 90 grand a year there and when I left I had like 50 or 60 thousand dollars saved I started Behance it didn't go very well and we bootstrapped it and I noticed that with Behance we were getting a lot of traffic from two different websites the first was called StumbleUpon and people and designers would post cool designs and we would get traffic from StumbleUpon and the second was a small company called Pinterest and I emailed both these guys and this was I forget what year 2011-2010 he goes I emailed these guys I go hey you guys are sending us like hundreds of people a day which for us at the time was a lot of people what are these websites and this guy Ben told me about this website called Pinterest and then this guy named Garrett told me about StumbleUpon and Ben was like hey I'm gonna raise a little bit of money do you want to invest it's a three million dollar valuation and Scott was like dude I only have like 50 grand and but I don't want to like look like a noob to this guy whatever I'll invest fifteen thousand dollars and that's a big deal to me and then Garrett was like hey my friend and I are starting this other thing none of us are going to work there because I'm too busy running StumbleUpon but it's basically like a car service and Scott was like I don't want to invest in a limo company like there's no way a limo company is going to take off but like I don't want to look like an idiot this guy's been sending me some traffic and I kind of want to like appear a little bit like a big shot and so he gave him fifteen thousand dollars I think at a three point five million dollar valuation and he did both of these in the span I think of about two weeks so he's like I basically had like 50 or 60 grand in my checking account at the time my startup that I was bootstrapping was only doing okay it wasn't making much profit and I was doing consulting on the side to pay the bills but I did my wife was like angry at me but I gave him each fifteen thousand dollars fast forward however many years they both went public around the same-ish time and I remember sending him something to his house and he sent me his address and I remember the address being this like really fancy town home and I looked it up and I was like doing the math and I'm pretty sure each of these fifteen thousand dollar checks turned into around fifty to a hundred million dollars each inside a span of like you'll have to look up when they went public but they almost went public right around the same time and he gave them money each at the same time and another thing a lot of people don't know is Behance his company sold I think for a hundred and seventy five million dollars and I think he owned he told me around seventy percent of it he owned the majority of it and so this guy has just knocked it out the park over and over and over again and a lot of it came because of Uber and Pinterest early on and he was like I don't think these are that good of ideas but I just I don't want to look silly that's a that's an amazing story I love that story it reminds me I I just got a dm from this guy by the way this is nowhere near related I am not trying to compare apples to apples here it's very hard to have a story that compares to Uber and Pinterest but there's a guy who I don't know maybe six months ago or nine months ago something like that I was like getting kind of interested in the like AI stuff about like you know this basically artificial intelligence I can create art and things like that and I had said something offhand on the pod so somebody reached out and they were like hey you know heard you're interested in this I'm trying to make apps that will do this we just released our first one I want to see what you think about it and you know we're raising a little bit of money we'd love to see if you want to want to invest never replied I go I get another dm or no I I see somebody mention this app and I go I go click on the founder and I click the dm oh this guy dm me a while back saying I invest I should I should see how it's going so I go hey how's the biz going I'll share this for each other hey how's the biz going and he goes good man good yeah that app I really ended up releasing it's been downloaded 120 million times and then I released another one and it's also been downloaded like 100 million times and yeah it's really it's going really well man how are you I was like well I'm I'm currently walking off of a cliff because I never responded to that initial dm you're like well I recently switched from trader joe's to whole foods the material with that I just did my 401k match yeah fascinating you sure probably not much you that's crazy I want to share one other story that's kind of related to the do things that don't scale this is something I actually learned from those guys Dylan and Henry so I'm a big fan of this like idea that you have to find a way to learn from three groups of people people that have done it before so people have done it a bunch of times so that's you know people normally try to go learn from them mentor type people people that are in the game their peers just alongside you that's kind of how we got to know each other we were in a peer group a mastermind group and no we haven't made it but like we're all trying to make it at the same time and so we can learn a lot from each other and lastly is people who are just starting out in the game fresh they don't know any better and there's a certain tactic to like a spend time with each of those three groups and then be be humble enough and know how to ask the right question so that you know how to actually get advice from all three of those groups because if you ask the same question to all three you're not going to get valid information you're not going to get the right answers from all three right like the question you would ask to somebody who's been through it before and the things you should talk to them about are different than the ones that you should talk to your your buddy who's going through it right now and the 19 year old who just graduated from college you can't ask the same question so i'll tell you something that the sort of the 19 21 year old or whatever i don't know how old they were at the time maybe 21 22 uh dylan and henry they were fans of the pod then they flew they offered to come help us with our video setups at the time well and previously they were fans of the pod and they would chop up clips for us and share it on social media and a lot of their videos were beautiful awesome and they just brute forced their way to having a relationship with us exactly and that became a a full-on agency that does you know pretty well they they did it for us then they did it for the all-in podcast they did it for a bunch of people and so people kind of know them now um but at the time nobody really knew who they were they were just guys who just graduated from college they had their own podcast which was kind of like ours uh but no you know you go you can go look at the views nobody nobody watches the thing that's okay like you know it's most podcasts nobody listens to especially ones by guys who just graduated from college but they flew out to our house there and they were installing the like kind of studio setup in my garage at the time and um and i went out there i was like you guys need some water you guys are like you guys all right yes have you guys eaten anything i was like kind of like parenting them i was like you know what are you guys okay what are you doing here and um and so i went out there and i started shooting the show with them i was talking to them and i was like so what's your guys is like i was like give me advice like if i was your friend and i'm like you guys got a podcast that's pretty cool like most people you raised don't have a podcast like what do you what's y'all strategy what are you trying to do why are you trying to do it what are you trying to do and i was like explain it to me like i was your buddy and they're like well um you know we kind of we like podcasting it's fun so that's why we do it the second thing is um we just think that like making content like we don't have money to go advertise we don't have like we don't have connections that we could just go knock on a door and get into some get distribution somewhere so like content is our only chance so we just wanted to get good content the best way to get good is just doing a bunch i was like all right it's another smart thing and i go but nobody's watching your shit right so like is it even working it's kind of like what you're saying about this band thing like does this even work like this is cool it's interesting but is this valuable like is this actually going to work yeah and he goes oh i'm just waiting he is nobody watches it today he goes but someday if we start to get people to watch there is now a library he goes we call it our binge bank it's a place where you can go and you can binge dylan and henry and i was like what he's like yeah well basically we just want to have a rabbit hole for you to go go down because if anybody ever gets it like today nobody's interested but if people ever get interested i want to have this bank of content that they can go binge and sure enough after like you know 45 minutes down this rabbit hole you're gonna walk out being like i think i love these guys i feel like i know these guys and i want to hang out or work with these guys and i heard that i was like that's really fucking smart i was like that's the way to think about content especially because most content doesn't just like immediately hit and blow up but you want to have this and i thought about it because i was like there are several people who i've gone down that rabbit hole with and i've come out with that same exact conclusion after a 45 minute day you do this all the time like you discover somebody you go read everything there is about them you go read their old blog you watch their old talks and you come out you'll be like this guy is awesome this this girl is amazing and they had to create that like library of themselves that personal library to go and let you binge and i thought about it because you know the band like the guy macklemore the like the famous rapper guy i remember maybe 10 years ago now me and my buddy trevor we started like we like found his one of his songs and we were like oh this guy's cool who is this guy and he had a binge bank he had these vlogs he was doing on youtube of him like trying to make it as a rapper it'd be like we're going to doing this show at this small college in wichita oh we like we're waiting every day right now we're waking up at this time we're trying to record in the studio because we suck at create the creative process so we're just trying to train ourselves right they were just like just kind of sharing along the way and we watched this stuff and we were like i remember these videos had less than a thousand views there were like 700 views on youtube at the time like i just went back and looked at it now those have each like millions or like close to a million views each on those videos at the time less than a thousand and we became super fans of this guy why because it's fun to be early we liked what they were all about and we felt like the quality of content was like higher than the views and so that made it for like an exciting it's like we found a treasure dude people say that in our comments on youtube like oh i'm like i'm i'm surprised this isn't bigger or like i'm happy to be here yeah they're like they're like i'm happy we're catching it yeah and and that that definitely gives me encouragement it makes me happy but yeah people say that and are you little do they know that like our podcast has like 10 times more downloads so they're like oh this little shitty podcast only has 10 000 videos on this thing or 10 000 views on this thing and i'm like yeah we suck share please share please yeah but i'm a big fan of this binge bank concept i'm i'm once i once i said that that clicked with me i started thinking about our stuff that way and then also i started remembering yeah there's actually a bunch of people who i've gone down their rabbit hole and like and actually there could be like a product that's like this i know youtube is kind of structured this way but i kind of wish that you could just have a thing which is like your greatest hits it's like yo if you if you're kind of interested in me this is the curated rabbit hole so this was my tweet that went viral this is this video this was the first thing i ever made this was you know this blog post i wrote back in the day it's kind of stupid but like you know it captured how i was thinking at the time i have two tools that i use regularly and i'm paying subscribers up the first and do you read a lot of biographies no none so i read a ton of take over the world yeah i read a ton of biographies and so any biography that talks about a person who is a little bit pre-internet era i'm a subscriber of newspapers.com which has aggregated like every newspaper ever so like for example i was reading a biography about dan gilbert or something about dan gilbert the founder of rocket mortgage i think it's called the guy who owns the cleveland cavaliers or i forget he owns everything and so like his company was called rock financial originally his company got popular in the 90s and so i just google rock financial dan gilbert set newspapers.com to 1985 says i knew that's when he started to 1990 and then went public in 92 so i was like i'm going to find everything i read all these articles about him before he was like you know it was like really like he was in the making at that point and so that's like my favorite tool is newspapers.com the second one for anything that's internet related is web archive so like whenever i talk to anyone who's like popular on the internet i go and look back at right when they started i like to look at their old websites and you could like see the trend and you can see the trajectory and that starts that teaches me a little bit about patterns and like all right it's okay and it also makes me feel like all right it's okay to be shitty even at this size it's okay to be only okay around this size you know what i mean totally totally yeah you go look at early startup landing pages i have a blog post about this actually like 10 throwback uh landing pages and it's like go look at the first version of airbnb of uber of snapchat of all these things and then you'll be like oh why are we trying to perfect this before lunch like it if you can start there and end up where these guys did like i can start wherever the hell i am now and launch and then make it better over time um do you uh you want to go to a can i let me let me bring up one so yeah this this guy dm'd me and i found his youtube video and it was really amazing so basically in two this has got me thinking on this whole topic but in 2014 this guy graduated from stanford and he got five job offers and he did this video that he goes here's the offers that i got in 2014 and here's what happened and here's like how like this story played out so he in the video it's really great so uh actually it looks like someone's highlighting the video what's his name how do people find this his name's rahul so if you google like rahul uh tech pond pond a p-a-n-d-u-y yeah so you google that or just like rahul and then like tech tech jobs and i bet you it will come up so basically i'm gonna summarize it but here the video is great but here's basically the offers that he got so the offers that he got from twitter with with a combination of stock and salary was 190 000 with a combination of stock and cash his facebook offer was 200 000 a year his microsoft one was around also 200 000 a year his square one around 160 000 a year and this is both a combination of stock equity and signup bonus and his google one was 250 000 a year now fast forward eight years what would that stock plus cash be worth so basically the stock the cash is mostly stagnant i think he added like an eight percent annual growth the stock he looks at what each uh what it grew since then so his twitter comp fast forward it would almost be the same because their stock hasn't grown his facebook stock it actually would have gone a lot higher but right now facebook stock is down a ton and so his facebook uh first year comp went from 200 to 220 his microsoft comp it started at 200 if you fast forward today it would be worth around 300 000 a year now here's where things get interesting his square stuff and and he was only 22 when he graduated or something like that and he his first year's salary but in comp back then would be 160 000 fast forward the stock is now worth a 580 000 and his google stuff was worth 250 000 a year now worth almost 700 000 a year and keep in mind so here's a few takeaways from this the first takeaway he said this funny thing in the video he goes square offered me something uh that i didn't think was any good because the recruiter said if square one day becomes a seven billion dollar company the stock that we're offering you now it's only worth a hundred thousand dollars over four years it could be worth four hundred thousand dollars but he goes i'm really doubtful that square will ever be a seven billion dollar company now it's worth 50 billion and it's down right now i think at its peak it was 70 billion uh so the thing that is really hard to understand is that everything at the time most things seem expensive and the reason why things seem expensive is because exponential growth is incredibly challenging to understand so if i tell you that something is going to grow at seven percent a year every single year that's actually kind of hard to understand but that what that means it's going to double every 10 years if it's going to grow if it's going to grow at 30 a year which a lot of these tech companies are that means it's going to double i think every two or three years and like exponential growth is really hard to understand the the another thing that is really interesting is uh leveraging offers and negotiating is very possible even if you're a 22 23 24 year old and so you always do better when you have another offer in hand and you play them uh off one another and finally the most important thing for people listening employees at tech companies 100 can get meaningfully rich and people don't talk about that enough because it's a fairly safe way if you are good enough it's a high bar if you are good enough to get but it's still like a million plus jobs if you add together fang i or around there and they hire tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands a year so it's not like that coveted but if you can get a job at one of these tech companies and i'm talking about a tech company that's growing quickly and has at least a thousand employees relatively safe it is such a good way to build wealth in a low risk way and the final most important thing on top of that is now's the time so we're you're talking about square being worth like you know it might be worth seven billion dollars i i have a very small lens here but i see what the private company valuations are they have reset and even better the public companies have reset so we have square facebook twilio maybe robin hood i think like a company like hubspot or something like that a coinbase all these valuations are pretty low if you ask me and i think now's the time where you can get some of these offers where you're getting paid 100 200 300 000 a year in equity and that could be worth potentially eight figures in 10 years that's really interesting and a great um ad for hubspot very well done very native i enjoyed that one this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform where everything is fully integrated well i can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a task from three days ago i totally missed hubspot grow better the um when we were selling bebo uh we had a bunch of conversations and then you know you sort of compare offers you're like all right we had i think at the end we ended up with three offers we had a facebook offer we had the twitch offer and we had a not papered but like only because we turned it down early but he was interested the the discord offer and and i did an exercise recently where i looked back and i said what was i thinking then because i wrote it all down and how did it actually play out and i'll be damned if i wasn't wrong on every single thing i believed yeah let's walk through this yeah let's go through each one so for example we'll start with the one that's relevant to what you're talking about which is the stock so so basically discord was like look uh we like you guys we think this is cool but we there's no way we would come up with cash like you're talking about so it would need to be just a tiny bit of cash and then mostly stock but like we think our stock is great so what would uh let's say let's say that you walked away with a million dollars of discord stock back then and back then it wasn't that long ago that was four years ago yeah less than four years three years ago three four years ago something like that so at the time i went and talked to one of discord's investors i was like what do you think about this and they were like well it's real simple like today let's say discord is valued just around two you know one and a half two billion dollars um so let's say two billion um or no i think at the time discord is valued at a billion and it was one billion then and he goes you're basically just betting that discord can be worth five billion if it was if it gets to five then this is the best offer and if it's not going to get to five then this is the worst offer and so you just have to like you know make an educated decision about that and i was like in my head i was like well i do like i was a big admirer of discord i was like discord is kind of amazing uh the ceo at discord jason he's kind of amazing he of all the meetings that we took i thought he was the he was actually the most impressive in there and he cut straight to the chase and was like yeah i'll do this no you know the cash is going to be small maybe one two three million dollars um and then the rest will be stock and so you know you guys have to yeah is that interesting to you and at the time i was like no because that sounds really speculative and like illiquid and like i can't go buy anything cool and i can't like i the total number as valued today sounds way lower yeah and in my head i was just like i can't do this fast forward discord i think is worth about 15 billion now so it would have been by far the best deal uh so a million dollars deal if they gave you a million dollars of stock and private valuations that would be worth 15 million dollars now in four years right right and we were getting more than a million dollars of stock if we had done that deal okay so uh so it was it was the worst deal it would have turned out to be this so now there was one caveat which is it was going to be vested so you know i'd also have to spend you know three years earning that stock or four years earning that stock which i i didn't yeah you probably would have been fired way before that yeah so so you know one of the odds i was going to capture all that i don't know but like it just shows you know uh how our brain is not really like the idea of discord becoming worth 15 billion was not really like it didn't seem very likely but in actuality the odds were probably in its favor but it seemed like a very low probability thing because it just sounded big it sounded like a big jump it's like is it am i betting that discourse can become 15 times bigger than it is today and actually yeah it did like the user base grew by two or three x the monetization grew the the overall market grew right there's like all these different ways that you just multiply these things together and you get you arrive at this private market valuation now and also whatever private markets have corrected maybe it's not worth as much now but like you know it's hard to say it's in liquid then the next one is the facebook offer and it's like all right well facebook's offer is higher in cash higher in stock um but we don't know about this we don't know exactly which which stocks gonna perform better facebook or amazon they both seem like great stocks and so then it came down to intangible factors and we ended up ruling out facebook for some intangible factors we which were in retrospect somewhat silly reasons to decide uh the first was like twitch was the leader in game streaming and facebook was like nobody watches game streaming on facebook at the time and i was like oh man this is just gonna be like another startup like they're they're at they're called facebook but like in this niche they're at zero and they're hoping that we can help them win and like oh man and we're gonna be pushing a boulder up a hill i was like i just want to go join the warriors and like go play on the winning team facebook just had decided they're gonna win yet yeah exactly and also like my mentor was like that's such a stupid way to think about this like you're gonna walk into facebook and they're gonna be like um cool game streaming's over here and you're gonna be like actually i'm gonna wander around this area over here i'm gonna go play in virtual reality i'm gonna go to ai i'm gonna go to you know news i'm gonna get he's like you can just walk into any other department you want and just go do that thing he's like they'll forget you even exist after they hire you like you're worried about what your day-to-day life is going to be like there and like you have no idea what your daily life is going to be like there and he was absolutely right by the way have you ever been to the facebook campus yeah it's it's basically it's like a better college the way that i describe it it's like a mall where everything's free so like they have like a food court and they don't have just one pizza place they've got many pizza places and it's one my wife worked there and i would go and i'm like oh this is the best thing ever and they have restaurants like a sushi restaurant everything's free they've got a ice cream place everything's free they've got a woodworking shop everything's free a laundry place a barber a dentist the barber that's that's the biggest one i was like food i expected but when i just saw you could just walk over to this guy and get a haircut i was like damn that was like that was like a big draw for me i was like i could just i don't have to go anywhere it's just free i just walk in and get a haircut that's kind of amazing yeah they're like it's free all you have to give us is your life deal yes did you say there's two pizza shops on campus so how much would the facebook so a million in facebook back uh four years ago would be worth what um a million in facebook stock would have been uh it's it's gone i think up 30 since then so it's like you know a million would have been 1.3 right so that's the like where the stock landed at its peak it was about double so at its peak it would have been double right so and so in that one we made the mistake of basically um optimizing for really intangible things one one that seemed really tangible was like they weren't going to take our whole team and i was like oh i don't want to like toast at the celebration party of this acquisition and be like but not you four they didn't hire you guys so like uh you know it's been awesome the rest of us we're gonna go and you guys you won't believe the recommendation letter i'm gonna write you right here's some cab money thanks for last night yeah exactly so that that wasn't gonna feel good of course as soon as we rejected them and they were like why and i was like well the team thing they're like dude we would have just hired them a few months later we just didn't have the head count yet like he's like uh he's like that's why and i was like yeah and the commute was really far down there he's like dude we have an sf office we could have got you in i was like also i guess the commute they have a bus like a bus that basically has like a restaurant cafe like toilet internet tv on the bus it's not even a real commute anymore yeah people on the bus complained they're like oh my god like the line for the pedicure on the bus was so long this morning it's like all right you know i don't know what you're complaining about anyway so we made a decision we made we made a really hard decision and whatever it ended up fine but i guess like my point is it's really hard to forecast and predict these things and especially hard to forecast and predict what stock is going to be worth down the road that's awesome uh so so uh i have another topic that i want to go to all right quick i two quick ideas one is around what i just talked about predictions so um there's this company that uh branded sent me that's called pressy taste i don't even know what this is a horrible name pressy taste you go to pressy taste prci taste.com and it's some kind of like basically it's a prediction engine i don't even honestly know exactly how this works but basically what it's doing is it's using data like cameras like historical trends whatever and what it's trying to do is tell the person in the back like how many burgers to put on the stove like how many how many fries to take out of the freezer because it's basically like how can we help you predict demand and so this idea aside i actually think that there's like a lot of different ways where this is really valuable so for example we own an e-commerce store and we're always trying to predict like how much inventory should we order we're ordering you know six to nine months in advance sometimes and it's so hard to forecast what's the world going to be like six months from now it's like oh yeah turns out there was a pandemic a war a war like you know stimmy checks that like caused everything to go up and then like everything could go down and then shipping broke and like it was impossible to predict but every bit like every better prediction saves us a lot of money and so i actually think that there's like a whole bunch of business problems that entrepreneurs could go after that basically just help you predict how much demand there will be there's a couple different ways you could go about this so for example for our e-comm store it'd be nice to know how other e-comm stores are trending are we all trending up trending down by how much percent year over year in our category because that would kind of tell us like where the overall market demand is another prediction might be you know if i'm a if i'm a restaurant what is the foot traffic or the sort of drive-through traffic like this time of year right september or in this weather pattern how much traffic should i expect today that might tell me what i need for staffing and for you know food today versus any other day and if you just think about like if you can be smarter and cut waste by 10 to 15 percent in in these types of businesses and these types of industries that's probably going to add up into like the tens of billions or hundreds of billions of dollars per year of money saved and so i think these businesses are very interesting this whole like demand prediction industry is very interesting to me dude i have done a ton of research in the trends predicting business obviously like we have this thing called trends and before launching that i was like what what do we do i think i told you about this years ago but everything i'm about to say it's from years ago of research and i'm doing it mostly off memory so i i'm gonna be a little bit off but not totally off but have you heard of this company called wgsn i think i told you about them yeah they're the ones who like they like say like the color of the year is lavender and the smell of the year is like you know yeah lily or whatever but listen to this so they're publicly traded so these numbers are actually facts so the 2001 just our 2021 revenue was 91 million pounds this british company so 91 million pounds so i don't know what that would be yeah like i don't know the conversion of monopoly money to real money but uh no 91 million pounds listen to their adjusted or their eBITDA was 41 million so basically for every dollar they made 45 was like net income profit and what they do is they tell you which colors are going to be popular and i'm pretty sure the product they only have 6 500 customers so they're paying like 25 grand a year or something like that and i think the product basically is a quarterly pdf that tells you what colors they think might be popular and i'm almost positive the way that they get this is they put like tablets at fashion schools and they just ask students like what they're feeling what they're liking things like that so it's like they're asking fashion people i guess the people who are like i guess they like like are you a hipster are you a gay guy who lives in fort green brooklyn like what like whatever you the qualifications are for like you are whatever you think is cool the normies you know like me are gonna like start wearing you know what i'm saying like what do you think later 10 months later yeah yeah oh do you are you an 18 year old who has 100 followers on tiktok check okay so like whatever they think there's gonna be cool that's what they like what they predict is gonna be cool and uh it's just a pdf and a real life use case of this is like starbucks is gonna like make a hundred thousand uniforms millennial pink is the new color so therefore let's make sure our name tags are this color so it's a no-brainer to spend 25 000 dollars to get this like quarterly pdf as well as the ability to like dm someone who works at wgs i would say like which shade of green is like the thing that we should be using and so that's an interesting business in this trend predicting uh space i um i talked to somebody who does like a fashion company or whatever and they were like a fashion company or whatever yeah as you can tell i wear a blue shirt my fashion senses you know it's frozen in like the third grade right like i was writing cursive the last time i thought about fashion the um and they were like lemons so in this year and i was like what like like i didn't i didn't understand what does that mean a lemon like i thought they're talking about the fruit and they're i thought they were talking about like literally like what you eat and they're like no as like a print or a pattern or a color and i was like okay so i was like it sounds like you're just making things up but they just pulled up their dashboard and they were like no like what look at the difference between like lemon and pineapple and it's like lemon this is pineapples were everywhere recently weren't they it was a bad example but it was like you know basically like you you can just pick is apples hot right now no apples apples are fucking out dude apples are like you know they're so out right now lemons are so in pineapples are so in llamas are so in it's like like a picture of a lemon on a shirt yeah like a design with a lemon on it or a pattern or whatever right like all right um or or you know same thing with like scents and color palettes and things like that and so and i was like there's no way i was like this is all just like you know isn't this just you know ad agency fluff they're just fluffing each other with these like you know random ass like things and they're like no like this stuff is like the bible to us we we need to know what people are caring about in order to do that i don't know if it's this exact wsn or whatever i don't know if that's the exact one but they're like this could be concept of like knowing which colors which scents which which styles which uh like um dude is that are in so that's so exhausting yeah it sounds like a horrible business to be in like if i'm gonna be in the fashion business i'm gonna be in the men's tuxedo business that shit has not changed for 100 years have you seen jack and titanic like that's the same shit i'm going straight big and tall for men because literally the only criteria is like do you fit you fit if you fit you're in if you don't fit you're out that's your only i was like that's what i like i like a simple yes or no when it comes to fashion it's just do you fit or not because i just can't find stuff that fits dude fashion's exhausting i i that's not a business i want to be in although i do think like there are some brands you know what brand freaking crushes it and i never buy any other stuff though because it's just too expensive but a louis vuitton louis vuitton uh they're like suitcases louis vuitton yeah lp um dude they've crushed it for like 150 200 years and it's the same ass logo the same colors and it's just timeless i do love those timeless things they do there's like a little arbitrage going around i don't know if you've seen this but like uh with euro months ago somebody said this they're like because the dollar the euro like got to parody and the luxury stores hadn't changed their prices so basically like um things were always typically priced higher in dollars than in euros uh or whatever so i might get that backwards but like you the louis vuitton bag you if you were in paris you could buy it in euros for a certain price that same bag was selling for more that same day if you just sold it in us dollars to a us customer and in paris you would also get the vat refunds you get you basically net getting something like 30 to 35 under market and that was like your spread that you could then go and sell it for in the united states it was like kind of crazy and so um there's like whole businesses that are around these like the version of a drug mule so it's like you can just pay someone who's traveling to like stuff a louis vuitton bag in their in their suitcase and bring it over for you across the border and um just because like you know going flying to europe to do this yourself it's kind of inconvenient but there's already people flying from europe to the us every day and so there's whole businesses that are based around this like travel arbitrage and i just did i just did research on one of these that i discovered it's called grabber so the url is g r a b r dot io so they went with like the misspelling and the dot io so you know they're really a startup but it's uh grabber dot io and their whole shtick is shop anywhere travel everywhere i guess that's a really bad tagline but basically what it means is it connects you with people who are with these drug mules these louis vuitton mules it connects you with people who are going to overseas places and you they'll buy shit for you and you'll give them the money and it's like a marketplace for that this i've got the stupid example of that there's this thing called a wicked laser because i'm like a grown-up dude i'm like is the wicked part just like yourself describing a standard laser or is it actually called that i'm a 12 year old with money basically there's these i found this laser online this laser pointer online that's so strong that they made it illegal in america and if you shine something like a piece of paper it catches it catches fire and you can't have it because it reaches jets in the air and it's a chinese company and obviously i saw this laser and it's a 300 laser but you could only ship it to someone in canada and i'm like i want a laser that can light shit on fire like why do you not want that that will go perfect in my collection of like tasers this one laser i have a bb gun a blazer a blazer from bed's warehouse my laser so i i had to find someone who would buy this in china for me and get it from canada to america for my 300 laser wow you should go work at grabber.io that's what you should go do yeah yeah we're just gonna sponsor every incel like uh subreddit like do you like lasers tired of not getting your laser tired of driving to canada for your favorite lasers use grabber someone will grab it for you bring it to you you're a 12 year old with money i saw this tiktok speaking of cool lasers i saw this tiktok of a laser pointer that somebody was in their bed and they're pointing it at their light switch and they go watch this and they just held it on the light switch they go and they apply just enough pressure to turn it off and i'm like this is not real i was like i don't know how this is edited but i was like the comments were like bro it's not real but like is it is it how does that work though i know this one isn't real but could it happen because imagine not having to get out of your bed to turn your light off at night just grabbing your laser pointer off the bed stand and turning your light off that's dude so just imagine getting an instagram ad where you see a guy go watch this and he shines something across the room and it lights it on fire that's what i got called with these wicked lasers wait so how did the way how'd the light switch go down uh no man i never got to the bottom of it i liked and followed to find out for part two they got me they said if i didn't forward that that take back to 10 people my family would die of lasers oh my god so stupid i want to tell you about another thing that's kind of interesting so you know like i think you met up with this guy i think his name he's like strip mall guy on twitter yeah yeah i know i know it's really like i'm one of the few people yeah no well strip strip ball no there's another guy who's real maybe they're two different guys all right i think strip ball real st trent and trip mall and strip mall guy yeah i met up with the strip ball guy and we became friends and so i have to make sure i don't accidentally say his name so one of those guys i forgot which one now sorry uh tweeted about private security it caught my eye because he goes uh man private security is booming right now i know so many cars like i've seen so many cops who've retired and um are just doing this because it's better money and i was like what like okay tell me more and so um and so i started looking into this and basically very very very briefly but do you know much about this like private security uh like you know like trend or industry i know that we used to hire them for our events because the insurance made you have one and you and i had a buddy who we knew who's a friend of a friend who started a security business he started like an uber for bodyguards right like did it work he tried no that one failed but he tried to make it like sexy it's like he just needed to do it not sexy so basically okay so there's some big players in this thing so private security so there's companies like securitas or if you just go to aus.com it's allied universal security which i think those are multi-billion dollar companies yeah so one's 11 billion the other one's seven billion i'm not sure if you're a tech guy or so one's 11 billion the other one's seven billion i think they do everything from like mall cops to airports to events to whatever else but like it goes like smaller and smaller more niche like down as you go like corporate security so for example i remember when i was at at um working at a company i saw on the ceo's calendar a a meeting that was like with like the private security detail to go over like the latest updates to the private security i was like you got private security it's like well yeah like you know it's we're rich worth a lot like you know like worth a lot to this company so the company literally pays for private security for the executives to be able to to you know to go out do their thing and be be safe and so i found this kind of interesting and it makes it like it makes sense to me and and uh it makes sense to me that there's like a private world out there for kind of like retired either army military or police that might be higher paying and potentially you know an easier job than what they're doing today who who are the executives that had security uh i don't want to say but are you but which company did you say the company i didn't hear you no because that would be okay to figure out at that point yeah i uh you know like zuckerberg and bezos they release what their security budget is each year and i think bezos was six million which is to me not a lot of money um right for facebook they they said last year 26 million was spent on zuckerberg and his family which was six percent higher than in 2020 so that's kind of crazy right 26 million just on his personal uh security you know how many people work uh work for the secret service no six thousand you know how many people they protect yeah you know how many people they protect 25 25 people spoken like a man who owns a taser and a laser dude i just know i met a secret service agent at a wedding this weekend and i just asked them everything i go tell me everything and i you know they couldn't tell me anything really i was gonna say pretty shitty secret service guy he's like big fan of the pot happy to share they just read out the wikipedia to me but like uh it was pretty interesting uh that's cool no i don't know anything about security but i think it's speaking of uh speaking of tick tock there was a tick tock of a guy who saw jeff bezos on the corner in seattle just like waiting to cross the street and he's just like hey jeff and he like had his tick tock recording or whatever and he's like you know how's it going today whatever he's like going fantastic and he's like you know he's ready to like walk across the street and they go and somebody in the comments was like the top comment was like check out the hand of the security guy and you look and he had basically a false i think it was like a false hand and his and basically his real hand is like in his pocket like probably holding a gun or a taser or some some kind of weapon and he just had like a kind of a fake hand out and i saw that i was like that's awesome that's that's awesome dude you know what's even weirder is there was a i'm a ufc superfan there was a fight backstage amongst the ufc fighters and security got involved and i kept wondering who the fuck is doing uf security they keep the ufc fighters from not fighting each other yeah you know what i mean like what what like what type of job are are they getting into you know what i mean like they just see like something happening and like what are you going to do well you saw the the woman that dana white hired the best buy lady did you see this yeah she was a football player she like kept the woman or someone was trying to rob the best buy and she like got down low and like an o-line like it was like pushing her out of the way yeah the robber was trying to run out the store and the security guard from best buy just starts blocking this person from getting this guy from getting out and he's like he's desperately trying to get out because he can't just be like stealing and just get caught inside the store and she just ends up tackling him into like a bunch of boxes she gets fired from best buy because best buys like hey uh liability you attacked a you attacked somebody in our store and she's like oh my god i'm doing my job i'm a security guard at best buy what did you want me to do and data white was like that's bullshit like he went on instagram was like who is this woman i want to hire her and she's like now he's like personal security guard or something like that like she works with them really yeah dude i always see those guys and i'm like who like you need like an israeli trained like secret service agent to like i mean who are you gonna have to protect a ufc fighter from hitting another all the ex jerry springer uh security guards you have years of experience breaking this up this episode is really good off a tangent but do you remember how remember steve the security guard from jerry spain who was like yeah he was probably like the top earner on cameo right now yeah actually kevin from the office or gilbert godfroid um oh shoot i think gilbert just died actually rip but whatever uh i guess i guess stop did you know that dmx died yeah dude yeah i saw that you you tweeted out why didn't you tell me you knew this information you withheld it that reminds me of what dave you know i don't leave my house dave shapelle was talking about like celebrities and how it's weird they talk to them during tragedies and he's like just imagine like 9 11 and and jaw jaw rule was like being interviewed actually and they're like what you know we we need jaw right now to make sense of this tragedy where's jaw someone go give me jaw we need john to make sense of this strategy this tragedy that's what that's like you're wondering like why didn't anyone fill me in that the dmx had passed uh but yeah he's he's by the way did you see this uh this blog post is we'll close on this little last random thing but um check out this blog post so this guy listened to the episode that we did with rob dirdek which is probably i don't know if not the most popular episode we did one of the most popular episodes we've done uh people love that one and one of the things that rob one of the reasons people love it is because turns out the kind of fun-loving skater guy from mtv like turns out he's like an absolute nut when it comes to personal productivity and like personal efficiency you know his quote on there was i am human optimization and one of the things he had said was he writes his wife a handwritten note every day and so this guy wrote this blog post it was like the top post on hacker news over the weekend and it's called write a note to your spouse every day a noted a note a day keeps the divorce attorney away and he goes um you know i was listening to my first million and uh rob dirdek was on there he says that uh he writes a note to his wife every day because sometimes otherwise she would be the last person to hear from him at the end of the day about what he was working on how he's feeling he was usually tired by then and wasn't really giving it you know his a plus so he goes for the last six months i wrote a note to my wife every single day he goes all right that's a lie you know i did it most days but like whatever here's how it went and he goes it's amazing like we're on the same page about like what's going on in our lives our kids our finances how we're spending our time we talk more than ever now um you know we have more trust we feel less stressed we're less aggravated with each other and like we're better parents because we're kind of like more in communication with ourselves um about parenting and he goes you know here's why writing is thinking so just writing helped me clear my mind it wasn't just me dumping my thoughts onto her it was me like getting my own mind clear and he gives this outline he goes here's what i write first i write gratitude like something about her you know for her for how hard she works for her looks whatever then what i'm working on today uh and like my goals or my deadlines anything i'm excited about anything that's bothering me uh any ideas i have just like random ideas on my head about parenting or fixing stuff around the house um transactional stuff like oh we need to remember to do this we have to do this don't forget that um questions like hey are we going to that thing or hey did we ever book that you know hey do we have an event coming up uh and lastly again gratitude for the life we have the things we have the time we have the kids we have etc because i don't do all these sections every day but those are the general categories of things i try to write uh it takes me just about 30 minutes if i'm not distracted and uh you know turn yeah it's been a huge like win for me is it like a physical note or a email i think it's a physical note uh not 100 sure i guess i should start doing this it sounds pretty cool right and then he did this youtube video with his wife like where they both like talked about afterwards because the post blew up on hacker news it got like probably you know 100 000 views or something like that so then they like did an interview together like talking about this little habit pretty cool right yeah this is awesome uh i just dm'd him while you're talking saying this is uh amazing and this is a really good headline write a note write a note to your spouse every day a note a day keeps a divorce attorney away this is a really good title this is a beautiful fine um i think i guess i'll start doing this right this is pretty sick it sounds smart maybe i'll start by talking to her then no that seems like a no-brainer i'm like reading this and i'm like huh all upside pretty much no downside why am i not doing this right good for me how can i weasel out of doing this all right my brain's not coming up with any valid reason not to do this no like the calculations are like going in my head i'm like huh yeah you seem like a good husband you you probably already do this you probably leave a sticky note on our pillow every morning no not at all i as i was reading it same thing i was like why would i not do this it seems really obvious but apparently no one does it my first except rob your husband's one episode at a time i feel like we had to we had to leave them with something useful because we definitely got off on like you know a tangent's tangent during this episode dude it worked for rob i mean rob is like successful have you seen his wife i mean she's very beautiful i'm pretty sure she was like a a playmate uh like a like a like a i don't know what the word is playboy model or something i mean she's like uh it seems pretty amazing yeah i'm definitely doing this now yeah i yeah i guess i'll do this why did this guy write so many words well anyhow it's like if you google here's how you here's one of the ways that i knew that rob was like crazy rich if you google rob deer dick home there's like 13 different articles and it's like all about like a different google's like 10 million dollar house did you mean homes did you mean mansions yeah and he buys all these houses and uh he seems happy he's got his act together so yeah i'm on board i guess i guess i'll do this fine all right you
