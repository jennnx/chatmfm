 back in like the late 90s trading desk was like a locker room it was very like alpha driven um a lot of hazing and shit but i mean i was at the time boxing for the new york athletic club i had played hockey i mean i was i worked in a prison for four years so these nerds were hazing me and one day i just cuffed the guy i just slapped him across the face and almost knocked him out of his seat and needless to say they fired me but i was covering these young guys at enron and they told the senior traders what had happened and one of the senior traders who happened to be from martha's vineyard outside of boston called me up said hey i got a job i didn't even know we had competitors that's how naive i was i didn't know there were other brokerage shops i was there like two months and um i mean i barely knew what a bid and offer was were and um this other competitor offered me a job starting the next monday all right we get right into this ken uh thanks for coming man i uh do you know at all what you're getting into or no yeah yeah i heard uh andrew huberman on the show my friend andrew good well let me um i'll let you kind of do the intro but i want to tell our audience what i know about you and why i think it's cool that we have you basically i was telling sean you're so we take pride in like finding people a little bit before they explode you're getting quite popular you're in the wall street journal the other day so things are happening for you but you're to me like you're like the next david goggins in my mind like you know you're kind of a freak athletically but you're also more so a freak mentally and you talk about a lot of like just being tough you got some crazy quotes that we'll talk about later about how uh uh you know like you like running because it's all about suffering and things like that and so you said a lot of really interesting things sean and i are also huge combat sports fans so i listened to the pod with teddy atlas that you're on and i know a bit about your background and so i wanted to have you on to talk about that typically we talk about business stuff huberman was a little bit of a we had him on that was a little non-business you're a little bit non-business but you had like a interesting background where you worked on wall street worked on and worked at enron i think you did a bunch of interesting stuff and so that's kind of why we had you on what um well how do you give your introduction what do you what do you say you do yeah well thank you for that introduction uh when i hear people introduce me sometimes i almost don't feel like they're talking about me because i i think part of what makes me unique is i at times have don't have the highest opinion of myself and always feel like i this i should be doing more but um i think that the comparison to david goggins is somewhat accurate although it's accurate i can see why others would think that but i don't think that it's a perfect analysis and i take it as a compliment no i don't think he's soft at all he i think he's probably maybe more more aggressive and uh alpha than i am i would say i tried to be i don't know i think that the way i come across you know when i was on rich role he described me as being his his initial impression of me prior to meeting me was that i was very aggressive and uh alpha and intimidating and i don't see myself that way i see why other people would see that but i think of myself is that that alpha or aggressive exterior is almost like a defense mechanism because inside i think i'm very emotional and sensitive and so much so that my way of protecting that sensitivity is to be so aggressive externally that it really takes someone unique and special to kind of see through it um at least that's my take from uh the the the psychotherapy i've been involved in but the reason and the reason we had you on we typically so it's usually just sean and i or it's like we'll have like billionaires and stuff on so like these like a wonderful people but something that like i've been thinking a lot about lately and i've been talking to sean about lately is just like toughness and like how it feels like good to get out there and work hard physically or to spar do things like that because even though we're doing cool shit behind the computer it's still behind the computer it feels good to live and you say you're not an alpha but i think in the wall street journal article you said uh i'm the biggest male i'm the biggest alpha male on the starting line i'm ready thank you thank you for pointing that out because there was context to that quote i said my my exact quote was when i'm on the out when i'm on the start line when it's time to go 100 i'm alpha i will step on your neck to win i want to kill you i want to destroy everyone but the minute that race is over i'm everyone's best friend if i see someone fall down in front of me i will stop and help them i've in triathlons i've asked people yo man you all right i'll stop and help you i'm not i say step on your neck and kill you to win but not really like this is this is my mental process that i have to go through to get to the dark place that i need to get to to suffer to the extent that i need to suffer to get the most out of myself running you know i ran uh 36 hours ago i ran the tokyo marathon in 229 19 and the day before that the day before that outside magazine wrote an article how 51 year old ken rideout runs sub 230 marathons and i saw the headline and i literally had an anxiety attack i'm like oh my god the pressure is on i mean i've run sub 230 three or four times but it ain't easy and i know that that last five or six miles the suffering and the darkness that's coming with that i can't it's it's literally the physically the hardest things that i've ever done is like you everything in your body it'd be like if you're driving your car and every single warning bell is going off the radiator's overheating the oil's low you're gonna run out of gas and you literally are like i can stop and no one would care or i can push myself and know that i didn't have another f an ounce to give and that's it sounds cliche it might sound corny but that's my process that's where i have to go to get to where i've gone to to the point where guys like you with this awesome park has want to talk to me like i'm a regular guy i'm a dope i i don't see myself as special with the exception of being willing to die to get the most out of myself physically on these particular days at races and you so you said you just ran you just ran the marathon in tokyo 36 hours ago you're here now and i didn't know much about you before sam brought it up sam goes oh i really want to have this guy on are you down with it i thought i i've heard that name but i don't know who is that and i was like oh is that the teddy atlas podcast guy oh wait what's his story and i as i started looking into it to me there was a few things that really stood out so there's the kind of the obvious headline that here's a guy who's over 50 years old and is basically flying through these marathons or running super fast speeds i don't know the exact records or what would not but you're one of the fastest if not the fastest corrected you're kind of in your bracket 50. yep yeah so that's kind of remarkable and i think that's you know that's the key thing i want to get to is like that's an extraordinary thing and that doesn't just come out of nowhere and so uh you talk about being able to go to that place at the last five miles what happens pre-race where do you how do you flip that switch what is your sort of like a mental state of mind or your psyche what do you do mentally to prep yourself before these races that's a great question and thank you for the opportunity to explain this because i think that it's um important for people to understand when they look at this just on the surface like you just described like wow it's extraordinary and by the way when i hear it it doesn't even seem like you're talking about me so i i i don't at times have the highest opinion of myself because of the struggles i've gone through with addiction so as i'm telling you this i'm super cautious that about coming across like a narcissist i don't want to come across like that i want to be i want to be very humble in how i describe this but i'm going to be honest with the process prior to the race i've spent before a race and this one in particular not no different than any other i spent 10 or 12 weeks like devoting all my physical energy or or at least 90 minutes to two and a half hours a day of preparing for this for let's say 12 weeks when i get to tokyo the week before i always go by myself my wife full of young children even some of the local races they don't come to even when i think oh i'm gonna win and you can see me win a race like they've come to a few of them and it's kind of uneventful for them they come to expect me to win and i in my mind think they're gonna be so psyched when they see me win and then they're like okay dad can we get out of here now and get a donut so um anyway long-winded way to say i have a very um a very specific process that i have to go through in the days leading up and again i don't want to sound like i'm like some elite professional runner but this is this is what i do this is the process i have to get there in the case of tokyo with a 14 15 hour time change i need to get there at least seven days early to get my body and my circadian rhythm on track with what i'm about to do because again i've spent 12 weeks devoting so much energy to this i don't want to mess around when i get there it's very specific i don't make plans to go to dinner with people or very rarely mainly because i'm a jerk i know it i'm very selfish to me again i'm not a pro runner but to me this is my version of the olympics and i am not there to mess around and have fun it's like i'm i'm on a work trip so i get there and i just need to be alone by myself think about what i want to do try to stay positive uh i'm a big believer in mindset and and and what you tell yourself is the truth reality doesn't matter like what other people think about you doesn't matter it's the only thing that matters what you think of yourself and that goes into the same that same thought process goes into preparing for this race in my mind i am a professional runner and i'm gonna win the you know olympic gold medal on sunday so i get there early i go through my process and on race day i've said this before in interviews it's like i'm not i'm nothing nice on race day i don't want to make friends i don't want to chit chat i don't i'm a jerk i know it so i try to stay completely by myself i don't put my ship on other people but i don't want them putting theirs on me either so i stay by myself the race goes off i know what's coming some people were like how are the sites in tokyo what were the people like in the race i said i couldn't tell you if we ran through the freaking imperial palace or not all i know is the road in front of me and i get into like a tunnel vision where i can't see any i mean obviously if i look around i could but i don't waste an ounce of energy i don't even try to look at my watch for i don't want to move any movement that isn't completely necessary to get from a to b as quickly as possible i'm trying to run the straightest line i'm focusing if people get too close to me i'll like kind of give them an arm like dude you're getting too close like i don't want to trip someone at the start of the race in tokyo i was on right on the start line and two or three people right in front of me toppled and it was like they were caught in the whitewashes surfers just arms and legs flailing elbows and knees smashing on the ground as people just trampled them at the front of a major marathon it was crazy so i don't want them doing that to me so i'm like that's what i meant about being a bit alpha at the start but i don't want to hurt anyone i don't want to affect anyone but i don't want to be f'd with either um and uh yeah did i see a picture of of you and jason calcanus over there yeah i mean jake j cal yeah how do you know him kate my friend casey nice that who is uh do you know his guy youtube yeah casey so i trained casey last year for the new york marathon my friend neve schulman who's the host of catfish on mtv he connected us so i trained jason and uh not jason uh casey and neve for new york city marathon and then i heard jason mentioning um running a marathon on on all in and i just mentioned it in passing to casey casey connected me i saw jason was in it we connected via text i saw jason was in tokyo i sent him a text and then we ended up going to dinner one night and then uh a tokyo food tour the next day we went to like some super high-end sushi place and then a bakery j cal is like he's dialed he knows where he wants to go i know nothing i was just like just tell me where we're going and i'll be there just text me the address um that's what i mean about the week dude you're you're in the in crowd you're you're hanging out with all the all the cool guys again when i think about my friends like andrew huberman and david cinclare and joe rogan i think i can't believe these guys are my friends i'm i i feel like the luckiest person in the world and i'm so humbled and honored that's guys like you want to talk to me it's just mind-blowing but it comes back to this point of i don't have anything that anyone listening to this show doesn't have i promise you i'm not a good athlete i played division three sports i was just a hustler and when i found running as a way of getting over an addiction issue with opiate opioids i just decided i was done being mediocre and we'll get into the career stuff and i'll tell you how i did apply the same practice to my career in finance but at the end of the day you know not again not to sound cliche but if you're not all in there's just too many competitors out there that are going to eat your lunch if you don't bring your a-game every day but when you do dedicate your 100 effort to one particular goal it's very hard to beat the guy who wants to die to win and that's kind of what i applied to running and and it's attracted these other kind of people that recognize that i am like serious about the things that i get involved in well the thing that you're interesting is the you just have an interesting life did i read did you used to work at n-rime no good question i i was working in finance my very first job if you want me to kind of walk through my career i don't want to like jump around i started in i moved to new york right after i graduated college i had a pharmaceutical sales job for a few months but when i moved to new york i saw all these younger guys my age working in finance and making a ton of money and i was like i was making like 36 000 in my like rent and student loans came to more than my take-home pay i was basically like living on borrowed time in new york living in a shitty walk-up and um long story short i was playing uh pickup ice hockey at chelsea piers and a french canadian kid all who played minor league hockey asked me if i wanted a job as a um like a trading assistant on a on an inter-dealer brokerage desk brokering uh electricity trades between the utilities and enron was one of those clients and the way it worked was the junior guys at enron would trade like next day power which was like the commission was like literally like five dollars but if you didn't do that as a service for these accounts they weren't going to trade the like big ticket items with you so long story short i was doing that the guys on the trading desk you know back in like the late 90s trading desk was like a locker room it was very like alpha driven um a lot of hazing and shit but i mean i was at the time boxing for the new york athletic club i had played hockey i mean i was i worked in a prison for four years so these nerds were hazing me and one day i just cuffed the guy i just slapped him across the face and almost knocked him out of his seat and needless to say they fired me but i was covering these young guys at enron and they told the senior traders what had happened and one of the senior traders who happened to be from martha's vineyard outside of boston called me up said hey i got a job i didn't even know we had competitors that's how naive i was i didn't know there were other brokerage shops i was there like two months and um i mean i barely knew what a bid and offer was were and um this other competitor offered me a job starting the next monday i was making 40 grand they offered me a job at 80 grand i mean to me that was more money than anyone i knew made so i was like and and the other thing is this guy's hazing me i had a huge black guy from a fight at the new york athletic club like i was not like a punk that you could just like i didn't strike you come across as like hey bully me i'm a big sissy like i was a guy you know so when he did i was like you got the wrong guy dude and i cracked him needless to say he almost started crying because i was like when you leave this office i'm gonna beat the crap out of you and he's like i'm not i'm not gonna leave i go you're gonna have to sleep here because when you come outside you're getting a beating and they were like okay ken you gotta go before we call the cops and again i had no safety net i couldn't call home and ask for money that was like i worked in the prison my stepdad and brother were inmates in the prison no one was looking to help me in my finance career in new york to them i was like an anomaly you know i was already like the richest person they knew just by having a job in new york city so um yeah it was nerve-wracking and uh so that's how my career started and the guys at enron were just like good customers of my clients that like literally changed my life but it worked out all right i mean i think at the end of your career i mean you're killing it yeah so so when that happened i mean when from the minute that happened within two years i was making like i mean again not sound like a narcissist and i don't have a lot of money i'm not a rich guy but within two years i was making like two million dollars a year doing things that to me were like i didn't even know what we were trading i just knew people and i had relationships and they were just doing trades with me i was living in london i was running uh i ran sales and trading commodity sales and trading at canter fitzgerald out of london and hong kong and i was flying on the concord back and forth from new york to london on a regular basis every single time the novelty like just never wore off every time it happened i was like i can't believe that this is my life much like i feel today i can't believe i've done this how are you making that much money that's just commissions or uh yeah so what goes into that how do you jump from like 80k to 2 million what happened yeah good question so um i was brokering um electricity trades and electricity deregulation had just taken place so you're putting together trades for like commodities trade on monthly contracts so we were doing that and um when enron went went bust i got basically sent from new york from at london back to new york because the business had dried up but i was like one of the biggest producers of commissions at the time again like i was so unqualified i didn't know anything about the technicalities of what we were doing i just knew how to found buyers and sellers it could have been houses it could have been baseball cards i just was had a knack for it is that like so when networking is it cold calling what were you what were you doing to actually be great what did it take to be great there yeah good question i hate the word networking i feel like when you're trying to network you're already like us behind the curve like if you're trying to make friends people ask me frequently now like how are you friends with rich roll and and uh andrew huberman i'm like i don't know i just i i must have something that they like and they have something i like we just find each other but i certainly didn't make a conscious effort ever to be friends with anyone it's just a natural process so to answer your question i just had i just had an ability to connect with people and i tried to have live a life of honesty and integrity and if i say i'm gonna do something i'll do it and i like to tell the people that i'm close with or when i have a close friend someone's like oh are you friends with that guy i'm like oh i help that guy bury a dead body i like him so much like that's my guy you know and i think that people know people that are my friends know that that's the truth if you need me someone's coming to over to your house they want to fight with you i'll come and help you like and i think like i said i think the people who are tight with me they know that that's a character trait that i have and i think it's what's helped me build the rapport with the people that i've built rapport with um but to your question um so i had this ability to connect with people so when enron went bust they sent me back to new york and again talking about reinventing yourself enron goes down i'm making a ton of money and these businesses like canter fisgerel investment banks etc they're ruthless so the minute shit went sideways with electricity trading they were like okay we'll send you back to new york and this was i lived in london during 9 11 and canter was on the top floor of the world trade center so when we lost 3 000 people they sent me back to new york and said hey can you take over our credit derivatives business which happened to be the most lucrative business in the in the institution at the time now if i didn't know anything about electricity you can imagine how little i knew about credit derivatives i knew less than nothing i knew as much as a plumber would know but i knew people and i knew the lingo and i just i picked up the phone and just in hindsight i don't even know i had i developed a relationship with a guy who's still one of my really good friends called colin stewart who worked at morgan stanley who happened to be a huge trader of these things and the market was so new credit derivatives and we just hit it again just became friendly we went skiing a couple times and um he started to just do a ton of business with me and at the time when a product is new the commissions tend to be big until people realize how much they're paying on an annual monthly or annual basis but i can remember one time for context and again i'm only sharing these numbers because of the for context of the podcast i i don't want to come across like hey look at me how much money i'm making because hey our podcast is called it's called my first millionaire all right all right so i'm on a trading desk there's a group of credit derivative brokers just generic credit derivatives i was trading credit derivative like correlation products like super sophisticated high-end bespoke one-off trades so the credit derivative desk has like 12 guys and that was like the product du jour everyone wanted to be in credit derivatives it was jam and they were credit derivative basically think of it as an option on a bond so these guys were jamming and we had a super busy day one day everyone did and the kid who ran the cds credit default swap desk says to me do we had a huge day we made 250 000 in commissions between like 10 15 guys so i said hold on let me see and i start telling everything i go oh dude i i was a one-man show i said i did uh 262 000 in total commissions and i think i was keeping like either 50 or 60 percent of that in one day amazing uh it was insane and so how did you how did you leave that why how do you let that go or you know what happens yeah take us yeah continue the story all right so when i went to london i was in charge of like a bunch of grown men and and i was like 27 years old but i was very immature like when i went to college i've said in previous interviews like i i wasn't prepared for adulthood i i just i grew up around junkies and degenerates and like it was a very hectic childhood and my brother was in and out my brother never went to school past the ninth grade he's only 11 months younger than me so it was just total chaos where i was and i just knew i had to get out of this so i applied to college like i literally went to the school i went to because on the application you could like fill in the little dots with the pencil next to the letters and it was like like path of least resistance in terms of applications and i could work and i had a job offer to work as a guard in the prison full time in the summer and then a few days a week during the school year which i did through college i started at the prison like when i was uh one week out of high school so if you can imagine being in a men's maximum security prison i mean i was 18 but i probably looked like i was 15 but i also knew prison is very segregated right blacks and whites don't necessarily mingle with each other freely it's not like it's it's like a different world but i knew most of the white guys because i grew up in like white irish catholic almost like not in housing projects my whole life but in that in that sphere so when i got there i knew some of those guys so i wasn't as scared as i might be if i didn't know anyone going in there which i know sounds crazy in hindsight now people know me like you knew people in prison i'm like the difference between guards and inmates is like the inmates have been caught the guards are just as bad it's like that was that was a big part of my motivation to get out of college it's like looking at what my prospects of life looked like if i didn't go to college and working at that prison i was like i'd rather be dead it was the worst worst to this day it's the worst experience of my life just the thought of having to do that every day for 20 years so um i'm working there paying through college i'm i go to london i'm now in charge of basically in on a brokerage desk whoever makes the most commissions they're the manager regardless of having management skills so i guess the what i was saying in a long winded way of saying like i had no experience or no i didn't have the maturity to be a manager so i really didn't know what i was doing but i knew i was good at brokering trades and i was suffering massively like from a frog complex imposter syndrome and i had a minor surgery on my ankle and i was introduced to percocet and the minute i took those percocets and the opioids i was like oh i have all the confidence in the world no one can stop me and thus began like a 10-year odyssey of being high 24 7 save for like a week or two here a month here and there like i'd get sober on my own just white knuckle it like go through the physical withdrawals of you know basically opioids just like heroin i was i was a mess like in hindsight i i tell people now when i speak to like junkies at like na meetings or aa meetings i speak at at prisons i say like i was a good drug addict i could get away with it i had resources i was resourceful i could find drugs anywhere i could get people to give me prescriptions all over the country i just i'm embarrassed to say i was really good at it and i was a functioning addict for a good 10 years and i'm sure people that worked with me during those during that period just think i was fucking crazy not necessarily whacked on drugs but it is what it is it's it's embarrassing like i'm i i could i get choked up thinking about it because i i just can't believe i behaved like such a loser and um but i did it and um and once i finally um got sober um when we start when i i started having children with my wife i have an adopted daughter who's 12 years old from we adopted her from ethiopia as a newborn and right before we adopted her i just went through like an outpatient detox got clean and have been sober since i mean i haven't been without slip-ups over the last several years like i might you know slip up hair in there but i mean for the most part i've been sober longer than i've ever been in my life and it's um you know it's like of all the things i've ever done it's the one of the things that i'm most proud of the fact that i was able to um kind of i don't say get over because it's a constant struggle to stay sober when you've been addicted to those kind of drugs they're so physically and and and um mentally addictive um but nevertheless it is that that's kind of my journey but um where'd the transition go from just being a normal guy to this kind of i don't know personality or whatever you want to call what you are now yep that's what i was going to get to so in 2010 when i got sober i started doing um triathlons i did the iron man in hawaii three times what was your first time or what was what what time did you finish in your first uh triathlon uh probably 11 hours and then my oh you broke 12 hours your first time yeah yeah yeah but that's like that again that goes back to mentality like oh my god 12 by the way sean that's like pretty good i mean 12 hours sounds like a very long time somebody's never no breaking 12 hours for your first time that's like uh that's a that's a great accomplishment right pretty good in like three years i got down to a 9 36 basically without even knowing how to swim and i went to hawaii three times but again part of that journey was like learning about myself and figuring out how to suffer and learning that quitting is much harder than suffering because the first time i went to hawaii to me it was like i had um made it to the olympics and i was so happy just to be there that when when i got off the bike you know it's two and a half miles swim in the ocean 112 mile bike ride in the hawaii sun in the heat and you start a marathon around one o'clock in the afternoon which would be crazy even even to do as a training run and um the run got hard and i just quit i just stopped i was like i'm dying this isn't my day of like i i just told myself every story that i needed to tell myself to justify quitting it's been a long year of training you made it here that's the big thing and as i walked back to transition literally like crying to myself like crying like real tears like it just it's so shameful because i know i didn't have to quit i had a lot more to get even if i walked and um i went back the next year and finished in like nine hours and 39 minutes which was you know i don't know where i finished overall but that that was i was very satisfied with that and that process of so so i used the endurance sports to deal with my addiction and then through endurance sports i discovered my an ability to suffer through adversity and i also learned the pain of quitting and the emptiness that i felt when i didn't give a hundred percent to something that i had committed to and um and that really began the journey so that was like in 2012 or 13 where i was like you know what i'm done being mediocre at anything in life i'm whatever i do i'm gonna do with a hundred percent conviction including work and if you look i'm happy to come back to like my career and how it transitioned into what it was into what it is because this is all part of the same story well let's stay with the with the mind shift i want to talk about two of them so you had said kind of like uh we adopted my daughter and i decided to get sober and you know uh made a decision but what what was the thought uh because you know after 10 years of addiction i can't imagine that that was that's the worst addiction opioid i mean they they're the worst and so i can't imagine that that was just so as simple as saying okay okay well now i'm this time i'm going to do it so what what was the thought and do you can you take us back to that moment where you kind of realized okay i'm going to do this or was it many false starts before it finally happened how did it happen yeah no that's an excellent point that there were many false thoughts no one who's suffering with addiction wants to continue to wallow in that because they call um those uh medication percocet like pain killers but they're really joy killers so what happens is you initially take them you feel great and you can maybe do that for like a week and every single time you take a a dose you get a euphoric feeling maybe the first time for an hour or two by the end of the first week it might be half an hour by the time you're in the throes of addiction you're only taking them so you're not sick and i mean anyone who knows anything about um withdrawals from opioids knows like i'm talking imagine having the worst flu of your life for seven freaking days and it can stop whenever you're ready to start taking them again or are you strong enough to get through this week to 10 days so then again just like quitting at anything you're sick oh something came up any justification where you're like i can't afford to show up here in like the throes of withdrawals i like can't go two feet from the toilet because i might have to use the bathroom i'm sweating then i'm freezing cold everything hurts i'm an emotional mess i could cry at like a drop of a dime and um so there had been many i had gotten sober for weeks and months at a time and then you know found excuses to go back to using but when we were adopting my children i was like i cannot live like this with children i have to be in my right mind i i and yeah it wasn't as so to your point it's not just like i just switched the uh uh i switch flipped the switch but i will say in terms of being hard finding someone that's been able to get sober from opioids is like finding someone like with a story like from the biggest loser where you see someone who weighs like 350 400 pounds then the next time you see them they're ripped to shreds and they're living like an athletic lifestyle that's i think how rare it is to find someone who was heavily addicted to opioids and is now living a clean and prosperous emotionally prosperous life that's how i feel it's it's it's so hard and only other junkies who've been through this can recognize the struggle that went into it and the strength that it took to get out of it like i said i've not always been perfect but i'm so grateful and thankful to be where i am versus where i was with regards to the addiction but yeah it was not it it i know i'm different i know when it comes to mindset i know that i have some mental strength that other people don't have i say that with humility but it's the truth i i i just decided i'd rather die than live like this and i don't want to die i can't find this client info have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or doing databases hubspot grow better you have an interesting perspective because you grew up with a bunch of people that are now in prison and you worked in a prison then you worked in uh in new york on wall street but uh now you know a lot of these like uh you know these celebrity fitness folks so you have like a you know a bunch of interesting people and you also work with teddy atlas which i imagine through that you've been able to meet tyson and it looks like you have dustin poyer on the on your behind your shoulder on a picture of him so you've met a lot of like traditionally tough people or at least people who from an outsider's perspective from my perspective are like these tough guys who are some of the toughest people that you've met and you admire when you think about how would this person behave in this situation when i'm struggling physically or mentally i would think one of the toughest people i know i don't want to get emotional one of the toughest people i know is my wife the fact that she was able to like stick with me through all this bullshit for the for the sake of my children has been uh incredible it's easy to be physically tough because like i said i mean he catching a beat and it's like okay i got beat up like okay not the end of the world we've all been falling down bike crash car accident whatever like physical pain is just momentary emotional pain lasts forever someone that's able to withstand emotional pain and show toughness and perseverance through emotional pain is a special person because like i said with like using addiction as an example there's a lot of ways to escape emotional pain drugs alcohol ultimately they're all shortcuts and um you know like a finger in the dike of the problem like the only way through it the only way to deal with adversity is to go through it and go through the fire you know like uh the expression when you're going through hell keep going or you're in a hole stop digging so to that extent in terms of emotional toughness my wife showed incredible um conviction and perseverance to stick with me when i was just a mediocre finance clown addicted to drugs behaving like an asshole worrying about materialistic possessions and worrying about keeping up with the joneses versus worry about just living for myself and trying to be the best person that i could be which in my heart is like who i really am and um so to that extent my wife is tough but you know in terms of traditional toughness i'd say any of the fighters we've had on the podcast that's um dustin over one shoulder and uh regis over this regis pro gray who's um 140 pound world champ um those are two incredibly tough guys but anyone who has the courage to get into the ring or the octagon and have a fist fight for money in front of other people i can you imagine anything physically tougher than that i just i have such admiration those guys how do those guys describe that i mean like this weekend i don't know how many people bought the john jones fight but i imagine he had millions of eyeballs on him he's like well i'm gonna get in my underwear i'm gonna basically i'm basically naked and i'm like gonna fight to the death in front of all these people that's right i and like i've read some like chael sunan and cowboy seroni they're like backstage they they're these tough guys and they like at the weigh-ins they're puffing their chest and they're flexing their muscles and they're like i'm gonna f and kill you yada yada yada but then they'll tell stories once they're retired they're like i had to throw up in the backstage ahead of that fight because i was so afraid and at the beginning of every fight it's just like a race you have these feelings of like what am i doing i don't want to do this why do i keep doing this what am i like this is the worst feeling and so they're kind of human but what do you think or what if some of those people said right before they're about to get in the the arena and just fight to the death what's that what did they go through you just hit the nail on the head i've had some fights myself boxing matches and it's whether you're in the ufc or fighting in a um a vfw or a convention hall every single person that i've ever met and spoken to and i've been in the locker room of fighters before fights many world champions ufc boxers teddy and i trained the light heavyweight champion of the world i was basically teddy's assistant teddy trained him but we were in the locker room for a pay-per-view main event fight and i can tell you every single person feels the same things that you and i would feel or that average person would feel they're not different they're not special they're not unique the coward and the hero as teddy alice would say they feel the same exact thing the only thing that they do differently is how they behave some people let that fear over rot overwhelm them and they cower and the like i i i i compare it to like surfing the waves are crashing down and there's that like break zone where you either have to get out of the water or get through the break and the coward either gets washed out the sea or goes back to the shore and the hero goes through the break and knows that on the other side is calm waters and is the place where you want to be with other heroes so i think to answer your question is they don't feel any different everyone feels the same thing they're not immune to the fact that there's millions of people watching no one is it's just exactly as you would imagine the only difference is how they behave and you just forget that the reason they train you train as hard as you do what they do is because at the end of the day you've got to block out all the bullshit because all that fear that we've just described is all noise and the the the amount of things and again this is all knowledge i've gleaned from working with teddy atlas all of the scenarios and potential nightmares that could happen teddy calls them like the ninjas of your mind the ninjas start coming over the wall as you're getting ready to go into the ring of the octagon and all of the possible scenario there's endless scenarios of things that could go horribly wrong you could die you could get knocked out you could get your arm broken but at the end of the day what are the odds of any of those things happening because you know you trained like a dog you've been in fires with these kind of sparring sessions you've done the running you've done the training and at the end of the day you have to block out the fact that everyone's watching this is now simply a more aggressive sparring session and you've just got to focus on the task at hand and once at least in my own experience whether it's a fight or a race once the gun goes off or the bell rings and you start jabbing or running you have to get your mind into that place of like hey i've been here before i know what's coming i know what to do even if it's not going right i know how i'm supposed to behave and teddy would say you know the difference what makes a fighter a fighter or what makes a fight a fight is when there's something to overcome you're not really a fighter if you're just in there beating the brakes out of shit competition you become a fighter when there's something to overcome when you're dealt some cards that you weren't expecting when you get punched in the most in a shot that you didn't see coming and now you're tested that's when you see who's really a fighter who can come back who can get off the canvas we measure a man much more by how they get off the canvas versus how many times they knock someone else to the canvas so when you have losses and setbacks and you've experienced that feeling of having quit or not given a hundred percent that's when you find out who you really are and that's at least that's what's worked for me and again a lot of reality the reality of situation isn't nearly as important as the narrative that you have in your head because the narrative in your head is going to control how you behave and control your mindset and that's something that's well within your control and you can learn how to harness that ability over time and through practice and that's why we train the way we do so i wanted to ask you about that exact thing because uh you know not you you run and you run these crazy marathons and these crazy times i think basically just been getting faster and faster every you know every year since you were 35 years old which is kind of amazing i'm not going to run i'm not a runner it's not something that's of interest to me but everybody hits adversity and so i think this is probably the most important thing that i want to learn from you which is uh when you whether you're in a fight or you're in a race and adversity strikes what is the self talk that you have developed that gets you through that because uh you said the difference between like a coward and the hero is the behavior but i think the behavior i would guess comes from a conversation that happens in your head uh deciding which way are we going to go are we going to walk off the field or are we going to continue on right um and so what is that self-talk and how do you train that yeah that's a great point and um i think that at the end of the day we all know what the answer is i like try to use a professional analogy like a business analogy if you're a research analyst right and you're covering a particular stock and you know that there's like let's say realistically 15 other guys covering that stock is like who's gonna go the extra mile to get it done right we've all just like at the start of race everyone shows up everyone there is good everyone there is fit who's the healthiest that's a big difference who's done all the little things so if you're doing research have you uncovered every every stone have you turned over every stone like uh moran buffett talks about that he would pour through um company reports i don't even think he uses a computer he's just old school he's just reading reece reading company reports reading balance sheets and i think that we all know whether it whatever our professions we all know what we could do better and i think when you sit with yourself and you ask yourself have i done everything think about how much free time how much time we waste in the day and and if you need an example every single time you open your phone and look at it for anything instagram twitter i do it myself it pisses me off because it's such a waste of time i've like contemplated getting rid of social media every day for like the last two years but it's it i would be lying if i didn't say it's been helpful me to me in terms of getting my message out there and kind of sharing some of the knowledge i have in terms of what i've been able to do with running but i would say that to simplify is like we all know what needs to be done you just have to do the little extra things that you know that other people aren't is someone else leaving early to go have drinks with their friend the people who are great that's their priority and again back to the concept of all in if you're all in on one thing and you decide there's one thing that no one's going to beat me at no one has to tell you what you need to do you know everyone you know spend more time doing the thing that you love doing if you do something more than anyone else i'm pretty sure you'll become the best in the world that if you want to be the best piano player there's going to be people that are just virtuosos so let's take out the outliers but if you want to be a piano player and and there's 20 other people in your class i promise you that if you train more than them and practice more than them you'll be the best and i unfortunately the only example i have for that for me is running um i've just run more than other people and i've been able to stay healthy which is you know i maybe part of it is luck i just have the physiology that absorbs the miles but i do a lot of other things to maintain my overall health in addition to running you you keep saying that you're like this you're like i'm a humble guy you know and it feels crazy well you don't say i'm a humble i think you said i don't want to be a narcissist and talk about this and that but you're you kind of are like this alpha cocky guy in a good way that's a compliment uh because i read this story and you you just you're a funny guy you're like you're like the care you're like the real life version of mark of a mark walberg character in a movie because you say these these these funny wisecracks because i read the story that's like 10 years old apparently lance armstrong was hosting like a man camp or some type of like you know like tough guy camp and uh i think the story is is that like you were kind of chirping at him you're like uh i came this close you told the the the reporter i came this close to beating lance armstrong in the first race i attacked him like a rabid dog i had a gap on him and then on the ride apparently a rock hit lance or something from someone's tires and you said i hurt lance armstrong i broke him i made him bleed and then you actually uh you got close to beating him or maybe even you did beat him and he said i'm the winner of man camp lance i need you to clean my bike and hose it off for me yes the initial quotes are slightly out of context because it sounds a bit like a dork like i would never be like i came this close to beat him i just would never talk like that there was more to the quote or i was and i did beat him in a couple of those clients but he probably hadn't ridden a bike in like six months before we did this together so like there's a lot of context that's missing there but lance is a good friend of mine a rock did bounce up and hit his finger and i said yep i made you bleed now clean all the bikes we kicked your ass and uh and then i probably said to him make sure that no one gets a blood sample that uh make sure no one gets a drop of that blood and runs a sample on it i don't want to find out that you're still doing any kind of performance enhancers but it was obviously set in jest but but you're you're chirping at him in a fun way but even like even though you had the confidence to chirp at him a little bit i think it's hilarious and awesome why wouldn't i he's a bike rider have you ever met a bike rider that was gonna physically like do anything to anyone i was like i think at some point i said to him like you used to dealing with like 115 pound european cyclists now you're dealing with real men like this is we're peers there's no like you know what i mean a less intimidating group of guys than professional cyclists it sounds like you better take lance to band camp actually instead of him yeah class is in session that day that's the thing is if someone heard all the conversations out of context number one they wouldn't be fit to be published they were like very um much like a locker room but lance is my buddy and and and all of that set stuff was just said in jest and teasing each other that probably wouldn't all be for public consumption but um you know i anytime you see quotes where it's like that like i came this close to be lance it makes me sound like a fucking dork and like i wouldn't talk like that i would have said i'm gonna kick your ass and when we get out there tomorrow i'm gonna do this and i'm gonna do that but again i would say that too i'd tell dustin pourrier the same thing if we were gonna have a sparring session i just that's but that's all i don't i don't want to sound i i don't at all i don't feel cocky or arrogant whatsoever i know that there's some things i'm good at and i know that there's a lot more things that i'm bad at so if i've come across as cocky i apologize it's certainly not the message i want to send i i think i try to be as humble as i can and know that there's a lot of things that i'm not good at but suffering is one thing that i know how to do are you making most of your income right now from your main i think you have like a like a small advisory right are you making most of your income now from that or are are you are you going to try and go full transition to become like this i don't know what the right word is what we call these goggins but whatever that is a personality that sounds like lamer than it actually is but you know what i mean yeah i know um this is a great question so i've made the most of my income through finance and um what i've done so in 2015 i left new york i went to california with a fintech startup um called electronify we were brokering trades between um institutions for corporate bonds so right now when you trade a corporate bond you have to call like goldman morgan stanley and you have to find they they you tell them i want to sell these bonds they find a buyer sometimes they'll they'll buy them from you which was the old traditional investment bank model right they'd hey i got 20 20 million of these bonds to go okay we'll take them there and then they try to sell them at a slight markup now they're basically just matching buyers and sellers for all intents and purposes so we created a new an electronic marketplace that could let these like fidelity and pimco trade directly with each other so i went out to new i went out to la to cover the west coast knowing that there was a good chance that this startup wasn't going to work it didn't we sold it to a competitor but i my by moving to la i basically forced myself into an uncomfortable position because there aren't sales and trading jobs in la like there are in new york so i knew i'd have to figure something else out and you know that expression of like hey if you're waiting for everything to be perfect to make a move it ain't ever going to happen you have to make the move and make it perfect and long story short i was riding my bike everything that good in my life that's happened has been through endurance sports i was riding my bike with a guy in my neighborhood and we were um he ran an asset management firm called the palisades group and they had maybe two billion in assets under management they were running money for all big household managers like all the household names like apollo for instance and and they had separately managed accounts so the fees weren't huge like a traditional hedge fund or asset manager and i said to him he didn't have a any business development he wasn't actively out there trying to raise more capital which is what he would need to do to really grow his business so i said let me run business development for you and he said you know accurately you don't have any experience and we're friends i don't want to put you in a losing position and i said okay i'll work for free for three months just to see if it works and again every time i've been willing to take a bet on myself it's worked out in that in that brokerage commission role that we discussed earlier i was paid just straight commission so when i was making all that money if i didn't do any trades i don't make any money but because i was willing to do that i got to keep more of the commissions so anytime i've bet on myself it's worked thankfully so he gave me an opportunity and i came in and in two years we grew that from two billion to five billion i raised uh two discretionary funds which is basically like raising a hedge fund first time manager managing discretionary capital we couldn't even hire banks to help us raise the money they basically laughed us out of the room and i said they said to me you think why do you think and i they said why do you think you can raise this fund like it doesn't seem like you'll be able to just based on the track record experienced asset class and i said why do you think you can't like until someone beats me at the new york marathon like i'll convince myself that i can win this whole race and long story show we raised the money we raised a 35 million dollar fund and 150 million dollar fund and once i did that and kind of started to believe in myself that i could raise money my boss at the time who's like one of my best friends jack mcdowell who's like just go off and go off and do this on your own he said dude you're wasting your time go do your own thing and the first mandate that i worked on was with um david cinclaire at our life biosciences i helped them raise 50 million dollars at one point david and i were raising capital in new york and we had dinner with um wendy murrock and um tony blair and bennett miller at wendy's like uh new york city triplex apartment on fifth avenue it was literally like i was watching someone's else's life unfold as i was sitting there having a conversation with tony blair over dinner and um so once i had once i had raised money for a few different independent uh private placement mandates i just started doing that full time and have since worked on a bunch of um mandates in the health and wellness space and now i'm back raising a um on a consultant basis raising a third discretionary fund for the palisades group and um so that's kind of one way that i make money i also have some invest i've invested in a lot of these deals i have some advisory roles um i mean i guess for lack of better terms some influencer deals with some big brands that have been you know i just feel so incredibly lucky that brands want to affiliate with me it's like a dream come true and then i also have a tv project i'm working on what's the next like five years going to be how's this transition going to look like and what do you want it to look like well in a perfect world i just filmed a pilot with a big production company for a network that's um confidential right now but if if the network likes what we recorded and i think they will it's unbelievable i think a lot of people will like it it's a non-scripted kind of show um with where i'm ho i'm the main host and um in a perfect world the network will like the show pick it up and i will do that and see where that takes me but i i like the idea like i always tell people like when you work for someone else when you're employed you're kind of a slave like they own you that you you can't just do whatever you want to do you get to have a couple days off a week they provide a little bit of safety for you and in turn you give them like x amount of your time but the main thing that you miss out on by being an employee is you miss out on the opportunity to pursue interesting opportunities when they are presented like this media project i'm working on if i had a job there's no way i'd be able to do it because they were like hey we're going to record for a week and you know out of town i would never have been able to do this but because i was willing to bet on myself and you know take the risk of having to get my own health insurance not being sure if like you know something happens to me and people don't want to be affiliated with me anymore i get injured i can't run like okay now what do i do i guess i could always fall back on a finance gig but i don't want to do that you know i wasn't happy doing that and to that point i've said this before and i think it's relevant for this podcast is that i've said to people like money doesn't make you happy and people are always like oh bullshit you have money and i'm like no i've had money and lost money multiple times when Enron went bust you know when you're making a lot of money you spend a lot of money and when that ends abruptly you're very quickly out of money especially if you have a 10 12 000 mortgage and now you get paid getting paid 10 grand a month which is what happened to me when Enron went bust things can change quickly and the reason i say the example i give you is i was making a ton of money and i became a drug addict okay so it didn't make me happier it caused me different anxiety so money can alleviate a lot of stress but it can also add stress that you didn't know stressors that you didn't even know existed and yes it's easier to have money than to not have money but if your only goal in life is to make money i would say be careful what you wish for because i was making money and i could have convened i could have comfortably continued to do what i was doing but i'm so much happier now wearing the risk of not knowing where the next deal or paycheck is going to come from but i've never been happier in my life and and this didn't this transformation didn't happen until my late 40s and when i finally like had the courage to bet on myself like all in in my late 40s it's been the greatest gift i've ever given myself is to like bet on myself and and and and live and die with my own results so in five years i hope that this media stuff becomes more of a reality and i can continue to kind of share my experiences and um you know knowledge of you know knowing how to suffer and deal with adversity and uh i like i like sharing that message i've done some speaking recently that's also contributed to uh my financial well-being and that's something that i actually really enjoy which is crazy right because every time i do speak to people i go hey is anyone here get nervous about speaking in front of an audience and every single person raises their hand and i go guess what i do too but i'm dealing with it and like i tell my kids it's okay to be scared like when they my youngest son's playing baseball he's like dad i get so nervous when i get up to bat he's seven i said buddy everybody does but sometimes we just have to learn how to do things while we're scared once you get comfortable uh operating while you're scared you can't lose it's just has to do with repetitions and experience how are you so i'm a former competitive runner now i'm i'm i just i'm pretty into fitness but all types of well-rounded fitness stuff and i get hurt you seem like you do not get hurt is that and part of that i think is like just biology i think some people just built where they can absorb miles like you said but what are you doing to stay healthy um i try to sleep eight hours a day i eat a very healthy diet i do a lot of strength training that i think a lot of runners don't do um and i do a lot of recently i hadn't done a lot of stretching and stuff in the past but lately i've been doing a lot more stretching and um i feel like it's especially in the last like six to twelve months tons of um preventative care electrical musculist i've got every like device under the sun electrical muscular stimulation theragun etc etc it's been um i spend a lot of time trying to keep myself healthy but it's getting harder over the years do you think that you know running 70 and 80 miles a week do you think that that's going to be that's going to make you live a longer or healthier life or are you just happy to you just like how it makes you feel because when i you know think about like some of these i did a half iron man nothing like you did and i didn't even do it fast but i remember doing all these miles and i'm like man i don't know if this is gonna if this is gonna make me live to be 120 it might not like or maybe just like lifting weights and going for walks might be a little bit better but how do you think about that i agree with you 100 100 i always tell anyone who's interested i don't know that this is the answer for me but you're talking to someone who is living the life of a drug addict to me okay if it makes my life a little bit shorter but it's adding the quality of life that i'm experiencing right now that's a bet i'm willing to make um yeah i don't know like i wish i had an answer for you i don't know what's going to add to my overall longevity um in terms of my mental and physical well-being um but i know that right now this is the best way for me to live my life look at what it's given me is been it's been immeasurable um but i think that there are a lot of things that contribute to longevity i mean obviously there's the famous longevity study out of harvard that suggests that the most important element to live in a healthy fruitful life is um relationships and um to that extent the one thing that this lifestyle and my kind of newfound station in life has provided me is the quality of relationships when i worked in finance this doesn't apply to everyone in finance but a lot of the people i worked with were real assholes and i didn't like them and it was keeping up with the joneses and i if i never had to sit on a trading desk for the rest of my life i'd be perfectly fine with that um again not everyone i met some people there that i genuinely love but there's some also some people there that if i saw them i wouldn't mind giving them a smack in the mouth there's been some real idiots i've worked with and i could go on forever um but my life now when i if there's someone in my life that i don't appreciate or don't respect i can just cut them out and move on to the next thing i don't need the thing that i have that some billionaires don't have is enough i have enough i have everything i need and i'd love to have more money and i'd love to put in a pool and renovate my house and splurge on a lot of bullshit but at the end of the day i have the one thing that i need and that's enough and i have my family and um so you know finding what you're finding something in life that you're passionate about and that you genuinely enjoy enjoy is the key and to me and people say all the time find something you love doing and you'll never work a day in your life there isn't a single week that goes by that i don't say to my wife can you believe i don't have an f-ing job am i the luckiest person we know and she always laughs and goes you're definitely the luckiest person i know but it's interesting that the harder i work the luckier i seem to get you're an interesting guy and we appreciate you coming on you're uh i've been following you now i think since 2020 whenever you joined teddy atlas yeah because i i listen to that a ton and they're showing us too and so we appreciate you coming on you're uh you're different you're built different you're a different guy and we appreciate that we like those types of people well i i want to say again thank you so much i really hope that i didn't come across as uh too alpha or cocky i just tried to be more than anything i tried to just be honest man it's like the the the world and the internet is so big if you if you embellish or bullshit about something there'll be someone coming out of the bushes like that didn't happen and this didn't happen because i know a lot of my stuff sounds sensational and crazy but i'm like i think if anything at times i'm downplaying some of the stuff because i know it's how crazy it sounds but um yeah anyway i i do feel very humbled and honored to be here this is a place where cockiness and alphabets is actually appreciated so so even if you did that would be uh you know right at home here we just like when people are the way they are and not trying to be at home because we by the way we don't get a lot of cockiness or alpha shawn that's why we like it yeah we enjoy it it's a good change but you know we're a business podcast for the most part entrepreneurship and uh you know we're a bunch of people with carpal tunnel syndrome you know it's not a bunch of alpha males coming on the pod uh typically uh so so you know i think there was some good stuff here for for mental strength toughness adversity you know but basically uh what i think is the most important thing which is the little managing the little voice in your head and uh that little voice in your head that you know that's who you you go through life with and i think that um you're a great example of what happens when you really like you know work on that and so so thanks for coming on ken i really appreciate it i would say this before i leave like that voice in your head is not little that voice in your head is all all powerful the most powerful right it's the voice in my head is the one that tells me to get high when i know i shouldn't the voice in the head the little voice tells me to go run when it's pissing rain or freezing cold and snowing so that voice in your head shouldn't be little it should be big and it should be like screaming from a megaphone that you're the best and you can do anything you want to do and to your point if you have a bunch of carpal tunnel guys here that like might consider themselves nerds and like intellects good because the one thing that you can control is your physical actions anyone can do what i've done i promise you i'm not special i wish i had the intellect as some of these carpal tunnel guys because that's the one thing i don't have and that's where i'm trying to overcompensate by being so physical that maybe my intellectual uh shortcomings can be overcome through physical intimidation and uh alpha-ness but anyway i say that in jest but honestly everything that i have is available to anyone i'm just literally the only thing i'm doing different than most people is physically is trying harder well sam i don't know about you but i in 10 minutes i'm going to do my workout and i think it's going to be a good one today i think i got a little extra juice you not think you know what is but you gotta follow you gotta follow him on instagram there's videos of him shadow boxing and uh right before he's about to go running or right after he got running and got done running and he uh i always feel foolish posting that shit i really do and then i'm like no i like it i watch it because i like running a lot but i don't want a runner's body and you're you're you're cool because you don't have a runner's body that's my mission in life is to not look like a runner you're well-rounded you're well-rounded it doesn't matter if you're 53 or you're 23 you look you look you look good you know i always i joke i'm like the point of working out for me is uh to be able to uh kill or outrun everyone in a room you know you want to be able to kill and eat them or outrun them and we'll add a third thing which is you also want to look good naked and so in your and your and your and your checklist it's check check check all right all right all right you're not gonna look good for yourself think about your spouse so that's kind of my closing salvo all right you're the man thank you very much we appreciate this i appreciate you guys thank you for having me you
